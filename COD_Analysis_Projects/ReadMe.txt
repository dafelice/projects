## COD 1
This document presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Call of Duty (COD) game dataset using R. It examines both categorical and quantitative variables, focusing on map selection, weapon usage, scores, damage, experience points, and eliminations. Various visualizations, including bar charts and histograms, are used to illustrate distributions and trends. Additionally, the analysis explores how player performance (TotalXP) changes over time and identifies the best game mode for achieving a high Kill-Death (KD) ratio. Missing data and variable relevance are brought up, ensuring a thorough investigation of the dataset.

## COD 2
This document conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Call of Duty (COD) game dataset while also incorporating logistic regression to analyze the relationship between player performance and team victory. Instead of removing missing values, the document explores their distribution and impact before proceeding with analysis. Various categorical and quantitative variables, such as game type, experience point boosts, deaths, objective kills, and map choices, are examined using summary statistics and visualizations. A key focus is on how performance metrics (eliminations, deaths, score, and damage) influence the likelihood of a player’s team winning, using a logistic regression model. The model suggests an unexpected relationship between individual performance and winning, leading to questions about the choice of variables or model assumptions.

## COD 3
This document performs an in-depth statistical analysis of a Call of Duty (COD) game dataset, with a focus on player performance and score prediction. It first filters the dataset to include only full games and examines the relationship between XP Type and TotalXP, demonstrating that the "Double XP + 10%" boost leads to significantly higher XP accumulation. A lasso regression model is then applied to predict player scores based on performance metrics, optimizing feature selection using cross-validation. Additionally, a regression tree is constructed to determine the most influential variables in predicting score, identifying Eliminations, Damage, and TotalXP as key factors. Finally, a standardized linear regression model confirms these findings, reinforcing the importance of these variables in determining player performance and score outcomes.

## COD 4
This document conducts a detailed analysis of Call of Duty (COD) gameplay data, focusing on data cleaning, map selection probabilities, and the impact of game types on experience points. Initially, missing values and inconsistencies in map names are addressed before merging player datasets and analyzing map win probabilities. The study examines how game type influences TotalXP while accounting for score, finding that Domination provides the most XP on average. Three machine learning models—Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks—are then used to predict game outcomes based on eliminations, deaths, damage, and score. Logistic regression is determined to be the most accurate model, revealing that eliminations significantly increase the chances of winning, while deaths, score, and damage have negative or minimal effects. The findings suggest that maximizing eliminations while minimizing deaths is the most effective strategy for winning COD matches.
