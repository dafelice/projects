# CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10_CNN folder contains one ipynb file. The notebook focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It leverages PyTorch for model implementation and training, applying data augmentation techniques like random horizontal flipping and cropping, followed by normalization. The study includes multiple CNN architectures, including a baseline CNN, a dropout-enhanced CNN, and ResNet18-based transfer learning models with frozen and unfrozen layers. Training is performed using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.

# COD Analysis
The COD_Analysis_Projects folder contains four rmd files, four corresponding html output files, one ReadMe file, and a Datasets folder with 5 csv/xslx files containing different forms of data from the popular game Call of Duty. The ReadMe file inside the folder goes more into depth about each of the files. The analyses involve data cleaning, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies in map names before exploring key game variables such as weapon usage, score distributions, and player performance trends. Various statistical methods, including logistic regression, decision trees, lasso regression, and neural networks, are employed to examine relationships between player actions and match outcomes. Findings suggest that eliminations play a crucial role in determining victory, while other factors like deaths, score, and damage have mixed or minimal impact. Across all analyses, logistic regression consistently emerges as the most accurate predictive model, indicating that efficient eliminations and survival strategies contribute significantly to winning COD matches.

# Database_UI Project
The Database_UI_Project folder contains a python file, a readme file, and a folder containting three HTML templates. The readme file contains a description and instructions for how to use the code. The project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to add and delete patient records using an SQLite database. It provides a simple web interface where users can enter patient names, store them in a database, and remove existing records. The application consists of a Flask backend for handling requests and database operations and an HTML frontend with Bootstrap styling for a user-friendly experience. Patient data is displayed dynamically, ensuring that changes are reflected immediately. This project demonstrates basic web development, database management, and form handling with Flask.

# MNIST Project
The MNIST_CV_Project folder contains three files. The ipynb file is contains the code, the html file contains the output, and the pdf file contains a written report for the project. The notebook explores handwritten digit classification using various machine learning models. It preprocesses the MNIST dataset by normalizing pixel values and flattening images before training K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Means clustering. The study applies cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance, while PCA is used to analyze clustering effectiveness.
