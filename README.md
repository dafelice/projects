# MNIST Project
The MNIST_CV_Project folder contains three files. The ipynb file is contains the code, the html file contains the output, and the pdf file contains a written report for the project. The notebook explores handwritten digit classification using various machine learning models. It preprocesses the MNIST dataset by normalizing pixel values and flattening images before training K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Means clustering. The study applies cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance, while PCA is used to analyze clustering effectiveness.

# CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10_CNN folder contains one ipynb file. The notebook focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It leverages PyTorch for model implementation and training, applying data augmentation techniques like random horizontal flipping and cropping, followed by normalization. The study includes multiple CNN architectures, including a baseline CNN, a dropout-enhanced CNN, and ResNet18-based transfer learning models with frozen and unfrozen layers. Training is performed using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.
