# CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10_CNN folder contains one ipynb file. The notebook focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It leverages PyTorch for model implementation and training, applying data augmentation techniques like random horizontal flipping and cropping, followed by normalization. The study includes multiple CNN architectures, including a baseline CNN, a dropout-enhanced CNN, and ResNet18-based transfer learning models with frozen and unfrozen layers. Training is performed using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.

# Database_UI Project
The Database_UI_Project folder contains a python file, a readme file, and a folder containting three HTML templates. The readme file contains a description and instructions for how to use the code. The project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to add and delete patient records using an SQLite database. It provides a simple web interface where users can enter patient names, store them in a database, and remove existing records. The application consists of a Flask backend for handling requests and database operations and an HTML frontend with Bootstrap styling for a user-friendly experience. Patient data is displayed dynamically, ensuring that changes are reflected immediately. This project demonstrates basic web development, database management, and form handling with Flask.

# MNIST Project
The MNIST_CV_Project folder contains three files. The ipynb file is contains the code, the html file contains the output, and the pdf file contains a written report for the project. The notebook explores handwritten digit classification using various machine learning models. It preprocesses the MNIST dataset by normalizing pixel values and flattening images before training K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Means clustering. The study applies cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance, while PCA is used to analyze clustering effectiveness.
